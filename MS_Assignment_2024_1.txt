Ecom Application:
Create an Angular,.net core application for following module: 
=================================================================================================
1. Register and Login module: Create a user module where user with following details:-
- Firstname,
- LastName,
- Email,
- User type,
- DOB,
- Username,
- Password,
- mobile,
- Address,

- ProfileImage,
- State,
- Country(State and Country would be master tables and PK(Id) should be saved in user table instead of text)
 
  2 User type will be there, Admin & Customer in dropdown.
 
-- Email id & Username will be unique in whole application.
 
The username should be generated by the System,username will start with EC followed by underscore then lastname and first letter of the firstname and ddmmyy format of User's dob. the username should be in all capital letters.
 
Example: If the firstname is Pawan, LastName is Sharma and DOB is 01/02/1990 then the username should be ES_SHARMAP010290, password should be randon string of 8 digits , we will not take any input fields for Username and Password they should be generated from backend and after Registration, Welcome Email needs to send to User with credentails.
Username and Password should be saved in encrypted form in database.
 
In the login screen there should be an option of Forgot Password, when user wants to do this on new screen or popup should come asking for email , user should put their email then validate this email is it in the system or not if not then say something like invalid email if it is correct then send 8 digits random string to his/her email as password.
 
Once the registration is done, the user can login.
The login will be done using username and password along with 2FA(2 factor authentication) , when Username and password are correct then 6 digits random string should get sent to user's registered mobile number as an OPT and save string should gets saved in database for matching it, if user puts correct OTP they they should get logged in(jwt is must)
There should be a botton for logout and token should be cleared in logout.
 
There should be an option to show user's profile image in right side of header on click of it user profile and change password options should be there, user should be able to update their profile with all the mentioned field.
Onclick of change password one popup should be there asking new password and confirm new password both should be same
 
- Once User is logged in in app- with credentials, we need validate it & check the User type. According to User Type show & hide few pages.
e.g:
Admin User type- Product Master Page will be displayed.
Customer User Type- Product Master Page will get hide. 
=================================================================================================
2. Product Module(Crud Operations):- For Admin 
Here we need to peform crud operations,
user can add/update/delete products
There should be an option to add product with following details :-
 
- Product Name,
- Product Code(unique)(alpha numeric-6character),
- Product image(image upload)-optional field,
- Category(string),
- Brand(string),
- Selling Price(Float),
- Purchase Price(float),
- Purchase Date,
- Stock(Integer)
 
All the products should be showing in a grid with action column in last, action column would have View,Edit and delete option.
Add/Update/View should be done in a popup
 
- Add validation that Selling price will be greater than Purchase Price. 
================================================================================================ 
3. Once User Login in the App, display the Dashboard with the Product listing, following items needs to display for the Product:
 
- Product Image(If no product image is added, display default image)
- Product Name

- Selling Price(display with the currency symbol)
- Add To Cart(Button/Icon)
=================================================================================================
Card Table:
- id
- CardNumber(16digit)- Integer
- Expiry date(mm/yy)
- CVV(3digit)
=================================================================================================
Following will be the flow:
- In the product listing when user clicks on the Add to Cart icon, entry will be done in the Cart Master & Cart detail for the selected product, below are the schema.
=================================================================================================
Cart Master table: this table we hold till the sales order is not generated
- id - pk
- user id
=================================================================================================
Cart Detail table
- id(pk)
- cart id(fk)
- product id(fk)
- qty(Integer)
- Once Product added in Cart table, add the item count in the Cart icon.
- User can click on the Add the cart button till the stock of the product we are having. Once stock exhausted don't add the entry in the cart table
 
Same way if we click on Add to Cart button for 2 product one after other, then 1 Cart Master entry & 2 Cart detail table entry will happen with respective details.
- At the top of Page show the Cart Icon besides user profile image, in which we will display the total Qty of all product added in cart detail table.
=================================================================================================
Cart Detail Page:
- Click on the top Cart icon, it will redirect to new page, where list of Product added in cart will get displayed with the Qty & delete icon.
- On Cart detail page, at bottom display the Subtotal amount, with the Pay button.
- On click of Pay button validate , if User is added his Address or not in the Profile section, if not show the popup to add the Address(fields will be       there at top) once address save, then hide the address popup & show the Payment popup.
 
- Payment popup will have Below fields:
  Card Number(16digit)
  Expiry date(mm/yy)
  CVV(3digit)
 
- If User click on Pay button, validate the card details with the card table(in which we need to add the hard code entry for validation)
- If Validate then, do following process:
=================================================================================================
1. Save the Cart Master table data in Sales master & Cart detail table data in Sales Detail
Table: Sales Master
 
- id- pk
- Invoice Id- alpha numeric(6length, auto generated -ORD-001)
- User Id
- Invoice Date(date on which order placed-today's date)
- Sub total(Qty X Price for all product)
- Delivery address
- Delivery Zipcode
- Delivery State
- Delivery Country
================================================================================================
Table : Sales Detail
- id
- Invoice Id(fk)
- Product id
- Product code
- Sale Qty(Quantity added in cart)
- Selling Price

Also new Qty needs to be updated in the Product master.
 
2. Delete the cart table data for the user. Means cart will be empty.
 
3. Display the success message & redirect to new page and display the Sales receipt from Sales master & sales Detail table.
 
- In Cart Detail page, if User click on delete icon, the Product will get remove from the Cart Detail page list, also we need to remove it from the Cart detail table.
- If all product remove from the Cart then, on Cart detail page show the message that "There is no product in your cart".
